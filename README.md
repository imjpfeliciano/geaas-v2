ðŸ‘» Ghost Emoji As A Service

https://geaas.herokuapp.com/

In Mexico we are very used to take goodbyes in a fun way, that's why when a colleague leaves the office we make their own emoji ghost to "honor the fallen".

The service requires a previously cut out image of the person's face and allows you to adjust it to fit the emoji. The tool has scale, grayScale, and X/Y offsets, also a way to remove the emoji's original face.

## Features:
- Ghost Face
  This makes it easier for you to fit your overlay image and it will look awesome when you're done.
